Once, and your shoulder to shoulder traverse the ground rain! Now, with back-to-back walk you shed tears destination.
You and me is friendship, I trust you like sentenced inverse of the oneself, that all people in the blame you, because you accidentally said shouldn't say the secret, I stood there at a loss, said it doesn't matter, you repeat sorry.
Both you and I wear masks to deceive oneself, I rely on you pretend indifferent eyes of expression, yesterday I rub shoulders with you, you turn a blind eye, I think you so right, no matter have, who all can not stand, do not protect yourself, you run away, maybe this right, friendship is like this, left, left, turn and see.
I try to hit you with the mood of the number, looking forward to your answer, you meet, I ask why, you say who you are, you hang up, I shut down, I crouched in the corner side face with her hands trembling.
You and I are puppet, never says exports, to "friendship" this two word hold in your hand, like whomever script walk, so ruthlessly back-to-back and never looked back, like dreams, only I remember you, know you, but you still live without my life to others and to shoulder shoulder to walk.
That day is my birthday that day, all is the tail.
Monologue.. I said I disdain, no matter be sorry or bye-bye, friendship, I turned back, you see, you return to mou, I also just, you smiled and said his remembrance.
